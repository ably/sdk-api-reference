A `clientId` may also be implicit in a token used to instantiate the library; an error will be raised if a `clientId` specified here conflicts with the `clientId` implicit in the token. |
| connection: Connection ||| RTC2 | A [`Connection`]{@link Connection} object. |
| request(String method, String path, `Dict<String, String>` params?, JsonObject \| JsonArray body?, `Dict<String, String>` headers?) => io HttpPaginatedResponse ||| RTC9 | Makes a REST request to a provided path.

| close() ||| proxy for RTN12 | Calls [`connection.close()`]{@link Connection#close} and causes the connection to close, entering the closing state. Once closed, the library will not attempt to re-establish the connection without an explicit call to [`connect()`]{@link Connection#connect}. |
| connect() ||| proxy for RTN11 | Calls [`connection.connect()`]{@link Connection#connect} and causes the connection to open, entering the connecting state. Explicitly calling `connect()` is needed if the [`autoConnect`]{@link ClientOptions#autoConnect} property is disabled. |
| time() => io Time ||| RTC6a | Retrieves the time from the Ably service as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Clients that do not have access to a sufficiently well maintained time source and wish to issue Ably [`TokenRequest`s]{@link TokenRequest with a more accurate timestamp should use the [`queryTime`]{@link ClientOptions#queryTime} property instead of this method. |
||| `Time` || The time as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. |

## class ClientOptions

Passes additional client-specific properties to the REST [`constructor()`]{@link RestClient#constructor} or the Realtime [`constructor()`]{@link RealtimeClient#constructor}.

| Method / Property | Parameter | Returns | Spec | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| embeds AuthOptions ||| TO3j | Embeds an [`AuthOptions`]{@link AuthOptions} object. |
| autoConnect: Bool default true ||| RTC1b, TO3e | When `true`, the client connects to Ably as soon as it is instantiated. You can set this to `false` and explicitly connect to Ably using the [`connect()`]{@link Connection#connect} method. The default is `true`. |
| clientId: String? ||| RSC17, RSA4, RSA15, TO3a | A client ID, used for identifying this client when publishing messages or for presence purposes. The `clientId` can be any non-empty string, except it cannot contain a `*`. This option is primarily intended to be used in situations where the library is instantiated with a key. Note that a `clientId` may also be implicit in a token used to instantiate the library. An error will be raised if a `clientId` specified here conflicts with the `clientId` implicit in the token. |
| defaultTokenParams: TokenParams? ||| TO3j11 | When a [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} object is provided, it overrides the client library defaults when issuing new Ably Tokens or Ably [`TokenRequest`s]{@link TokenRequest}. |
| echoMessages: Bool default true ||| RTC1a, TO3h | If `false`, prevents messages originating from this connection being echoed back on the same connection. The default is `true`. |
| environment: String? ||| RSC15b, TO3k1 | Enables a [custom environment](https://ably.com/docs/platform-customization) to be used with the Ably service. |
| logHandler: ||| platform specific - TO3c | Controls the log output of the library. This is a function to handle each line of log output. |
| logLevel: ||| platform specific - TO3b | Controls the verbosity of the logs output from the library. Levels include `verbose`, `debug`, `info`, `warn` and `error`.  |
| logExceptionReportingUrl: String default "[library specific]" ||| TO3m (deprecated) | DEPRECATED: this property is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Defaults to a string value for an Ably error reporting DSN (Data Source Name), which is typically a URL in the format `https://[KEY]:[SECRET]@errors.ably.io/[ID]`. When set to `null`, `false` or an empty string (depending on what is idiomatic for the platform), exception reporting is disabled. |
| port: Int default 80 ||| TO3k4 | Enables a non-default Ably port to be specified. For development environments only. The default value is 80. |
| queueMessages: Bool default true ||| RTP16b, TO3g | If `false`, this disables the default behavior whereby the library queues messages on a connection in the disconnected or connecting states. The default behavior enables applications to submit messages immediately upon instantiating the library without having to wait for the connection to be established. Applications may use this option to disable queueing if they wish to have application-level control over the queueing. The default is `true`. |
| restHost: String default "rest.ably.io" ||| RSC12, TO3k2 | Enables a non-default Ably host to be specified. For development environments only. The default value is `rest.ably.io`. |
| realtimeHost: String default "realtime.ably.io" ||| RTC1d, TO3k3 | Enables a non-default Ably host to be specified for realtime connections. For development environments only. The default value is `realtime.ably.io`. |
| fallbackHosts: String[] default nil ||| RSC15b, RSC15a, TO3k6 | An array of fallback hosts to be used in the case of an error necessitating the use of an alternative host. If you have been provided a set of custom fallback hosts by Ably, please specify them here.|
| fallbackHostsUseDefault: Bool default false ||| TO3k7 (deprecated) | DEPRECATED: this property is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Enables default fallback hosts to be used. |
| recover: String? ||| RTC1c, TO3i | Enables a connection to inherit the state of a previous connection that may have existed under a different instance of the Realtime library. This might typically be used by clients of the browser library to ensure connection state can be preserved when the user refreshes the page. A recovery key string can be explicitly provided, or alternatively if a callback function is provided, the client library will automatically persist the recovery key between page reloads and call the callback when the connection is recoverable. The callback is then responsible for confirming whether the connection should be recovered or not. See [connection state recovery](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection/#connection-state-recovery) for further information. |
| tls: Bool default true ||| RSC18, TO3d | When `false`, the client will use an insecure connection. The default is `true`, meaning a TLS connection will be used to connect to Ably. |
| tlsPort: Int default 443 ||| TO3k5 | Enables a non-default Ably TLS port to be specified. For development environments only. The default value is 443. |
| useBinaryProtocol: Bool default true ||| TO3f | When `true`, the more efficient MsgPack binary encoding is used. When `false`, JSON text encoding is used. The default is `true`. |
| transportParams: [String: Stringifiable]? ||| RTC1f | A set of key-value pairs that can be used to pass in arbitrary connection parameters, such as [`heartbeatInterval`](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/connection#heartbeats) or [`remainPresentFor`](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/presence#unstable-connections). |
| addRequestIds: Bool default false ||| TO3p | When `true`, every REST request to Ably should include a random string in the `request_id` query string parameter. The random string should be a url-safe base64-encoding sequence of at least 9 bytes, obtained from a source of randomness. This request ID must remain the same if a request is retried to a fallback host. Any log messages associated with the request should include the request ID. If the request fails, the request ID must be included in the [`ErrorInfo`]{@link ErrorInfo} returned to the user. The default is `false`. |
| disconnectedRetryTimeout: Duration default 15s ||| TO3l1 | When the connection enters the [`DISCONNECTED`]{@link ConnectionState#disconnected} state, after this delay, if the state is still [`DISCONNECTED`]{@link ConnectionState#disconnected}, the client library will attempt to reconnect automatically. The default is 15 seconds. |
| suspendedRetryTimeout: Duration default 30s ||| RTN14d, TO3l2 | When the connection enters the [`SUSPENDED`]{@link ConnectionState#suspended} state, after this delay, if the state is still [`SUSPENDED`]{@link ConnectionState#suspended}, the client library attempts to reconnect automatically. The default is 30 seconds. |
| channelRetryTimeout: Duration default 15s ||| RTL13b, TO3l7 | When a channel becomes [`SUSPENDED`]{@link ChannelState#suspended} following a server initiated [`DETACHED`]{@link ChannelState#detached}, after this delay, if the channel is still [`SUSPENDED`]{@link ChannelState#suspended} and the connection is in [`CONNECTED`]{@link ConnectionState#connected}, the client library will attempt to re-attach the channel automatically. The default is 15 seconds. |
| httpOpenTimeout: Duration default 4s ||| TO3l3 | Timeout for opening a connection to Ably to initiate an HTTP request. The default is 4 seconds. |
| httpRequestTimeout: Duration default 10s ||| TO3l4 | Timeout for a client performing a complete HTTP request to Ably, including the connection phase. The default is 10 seconds. |
| realtimeRequestTimeout: Duration default 10s ||| TO3l11 | Timeout for the wait of acknowledgement for operations performed via a realtime connection, before the client library considers a request failed and triggers a failure condition. Operations include establishing a connection with Ably, or sending a `HEARTBEAT`, `CONNECT`, `ATTACH`, `DETACH` or `CLOSE` request. It is the equivalent of `httpRequestTimeout` but for realtime operations, rather than REST. The default is 10 seconds. |
| httpMaxRetryCount: Int default 3 ||| TO3l5 | The maximum number of fallback hosts to use as a fallback when an HTTP request to the primary host is unreachable or indicates that it is unserviceable. The default value is 3. |
| httpMaxRetryDuration: Duration default 15s ||| TO3l6 | The maximum elapsed time in which fallback host retries for HTTP requests will be attempted. The default is 15 seconds. |
| maxMessageSize: Int default 65536 ||| TO3l8 | The maximum message size is an attribute of an Ably account which represents the largest permitted payload size of a single message or set of messages published in a single operation. Publish requests whose payload exceeds this limit are rejected by the server. `maxMessageSize` enables the client to enforce, or further restrict, the maximum size of a single message or set of messages published via REST. The default value is `65536` (64 KiB). In the case of a realtime connection, the server may indicate the associated maximum message size on connection establishment; this value takes precedence over the client's default `maxMessageSize`. |
| maxFrameSize: Int default 524288 ||| TO3l8 | The maximum size of a single POST body or WebSocket frame. This is mostly only relevant for a REST client request (for batch publishes), since publishes will hit the `maxMessageSize` limit before this. The default value is `524288` (512 KiB). |
| fallbackRetryTimeout: Duration default 600s ||| TO3l10 | The maximum time before HTTP requests are retried against the default endpoint. The default is 600 seconds. |
| plugins: `Dict<PluginType, Plugin>` ||| TO3o | A map between a [`PluginType`]{@link PluginType} and a `Plugin` object. |
| idempotentRestPublishing: bool default true ||| RSL1k1, RTL6a1, TO3n | When `true`, enables idempotent publishing by assigning a unique message ID client-side, allowing the Ably servers to discard automatic publish retries following a failure such as a network fault. The default is `true`. |
| agents: [String: String?]? ||| RSC7d6 - interface only offered by some libraries | A set of additional entries for the Ably agent header. Each entry can be a key string or set of key-value pairs. |

## class AuthOptions

Passes authentication-specific properties in authentication requests to Ably. Properties set using `AuthOptions` are used instead of the default values set when the client library is instantiated, as opposed to being merged with them.

| Method / Property | Parameter | Returns | Spec | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| authCallback: ((TokenParams) -> io (String \| TokenDetails \| TokenRequest \| JsonObject))? ||| RSA4a, RSA4, TO3j5, AO2b | Called when a new token is required. The role of the callback is to obtain a fresh token, one of: an Ably Token string (in plain text format); a signed [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest}; a [`TokenDetails`]{@link TokenDetails} (in JSON format); an [Ably JWT](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt). See [the authentication documentation](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/authentication) for details of the Ably [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} format and associated API calls. |
| authHeaders: [String: Stringifiable]? ||| RSA8c3, TO3j8, AO2e | A set of key-value pair headers to be added to any request made to the `authUrl`. Useful when an application requires these to be added to validate the request or implement the response. If the `authHeaders` object contains an `authorization` key, then `withCredentials` is set on the XHR request. |
| authMethod: .GET \| .POST default .GET ||| RSA8c, TO3j7, AO2d | The HTTP verb to use for any request made to the `authUrl`, either `GET` or `POST`. The default value is `GET`.  |
| authParams: [String: Stringifiable]? ||| RSA8c3, RSA8c1, TO3j9, AO2f | A set of key-value pair params to be added to any request made to the `authUrl`. When the `authMethod` is `GET`, query params are added to the URL, whereas when `authMethod` is `POST`, the params are sent as URL encoded form data. Useful when an application requires these to be added to validate the request or implement the response. |
| authUrl: String? ||| RSA4a, RSA4, RSA8c, TO3j6, AO2c | A URL that the library may use to obtain a token string (in plain text format), or a signed [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} or [`TokenDetails`]{@link TokenDetails} (in JSON format) from. |
| key: String? ||| RSA11, RSA14, TO3j1, AO2a | The full API key string, as obtained from the [Ably dashboard](https://ably.com/dashboard). Use this option if you wish to use Basic authentication, or wish to be able to issue Ably Tokens without needing to defer to a separate entity to sign Ably [`TokenRequest`s]{@link TokenRequest}. Read more about [Basic authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#basic-authentication). |
| queryTime: Bool default false ||| RSA9d, TO3j10, AO2a | If `true`, the library queries the Ably servers for the current time when issuing [`TokenRequest`s]{@link TokenRequest} instead of relying on a locally-available time of day. Knowing the time accurately is needed to create valid signed Ably [`TokenRequest`s]{@link TokenRequest}, so this option is useful for library instances on auth servers where for some reason the server clock cannot be kept synchronized through normal means, such as an [NTP daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ntpd). The server is queried for the current time once per client library instance (which stores the offset from the local clock), so if using this option you should avoid instancing a new version of the library for each request. The default is `false`. |
| token: String? \| TokenDetails? \| TokenRequest? ||| RSA4a, RSA4, TO3j2 | An authenticated token. This can either be a [`TokenDetails`]{@link TokenDetails} object, a [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} object, or token string (obtained from the `token` property of a [`TokenDetails`]{@link TokenDetails} component of an Ably [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} response, or a JSON Web Token satisfying [the Ably requirements for JWTs](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#ably-jwt)). This option is mostly useful for testing: since tokens are short-lived, in production you almost always want to use an authentication method that enables the client library to renew the token automatically when the previous one expires, such as `authUrl` or `authCallback`. Read more about [Token authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#token-authentication). |
| tokenDetails: TokenDetails? ||| RSA4a, RSA4, TO3j3 | An authenticated [`TokenDetails`]{@link TokenDetails} object (most commonly obtained from an Ably Token Request response). This option is mostly useful for testing: since tokens are short-lived, in production you almost always want to use an authentication method that enables the client library to renew the token automatically when the previous one expires, such as `authUrl` or `authCallback`. Use this option if you wish to use Token authentication. Read more about [Token authentication](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#token-authentication). |
| useTokenAuth: Bool? ||| RSA4, RSA14, TO3j4 | When `true`, forces token authentication to be used by the library. If a `clientId` is not specified in the [`ClientOptions`]{@link ClientOptions} or [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams}, then the Ably Token issued is [anonymous](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#identified-clients). |

## class TokenParams

Defines the properties of an Ably Token.

|  Method / Property | Parameter | Returns | Spec | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| capability: String api-default `'{"*":["*"]}'` ||| RSA9f, TK2b | The capabilities associated with this Ably Token. The capabilities value is a JSON-encoded representation of the resource paths and associated operations. Read more about capabilities in the [capabilities docs](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication/#capabilities-explained). |
| clientId: String? ||| TK2c | A client ID, used for identifying this client when publishing messages or for presence purposes. The `clientId` can be any non-empty string, except it cannot contain a `*`. This option is primarily intended to be used in situations where the library is instantiated with a key. Note that a `clientId` may also be implicit in a token used to instantiate the library. An error is raised if a `clientId` specified here conflicts with the `clientId` implicit in the token. Find out more about [identified clients](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#identified-clients). |
| nonce: String? ||| RSA9c, Tk2d | A cryptographically secure random string of at least 16 characters, used to ensure the [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} cannot be reused. |
| timestamp: Time? ||| RSA9d, Tk2d | The timestamp of this request as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Timestamps, in conjunction with the `nonce`, are used to prevent requests from being replayed. `timestamp` is a "one-time" value, and is valid in a request, but is not validly a member of any default token params such as `ClientOptions.defaultTokenParams`. |
| ttl: Duration api-default 60min ||| RSA9e, TK2a | Requested time to live for the token in milliseconds. The default is 60 minutes. |

## class Auth

Creates Ably [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} objects and obtains Ably Tokens from Ably to subsequently issue to less trusted clients.

|  Method / Property | Parameter | Returns | Spec | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| clientId: String? ||| RSA7, RSC17, RSA12 | A client ID, used for identifying this client when publishing messages or for presence purposes. The `clientId` can be any non-empty string, except it cannot contain a `*`. This option is primarily intended to be used in situations where the library is instantiated with a key. Note that a `clientId` may also be implicit in a token used to instantiate the library. An error is raised if a `clientId` specified here conflicts with the `clientId` implicit in the token.

| authorize(TokenParams?, AuthOptions?) => io TokenDetails ||| RSA10 | Instructs the library to get a new token immediately. When using the realtime client, it upgrades the current realtime connection to use the new token, or if not connected, initiates a connection to Ably, once the new token has been obtained. Also stores any [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} and [`AuthOptions`]{@link AuthOptions} passed in as the new defaults, to be used for all subsequent implicit or explicit token requests. Any [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} and [`AuthOptions`]{@link AuthOptions} objects passed in entirely replace, as opposed to being merged with, the current client library saved values. |
|| `TokenParams` ||| A [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} object. |
|| `AuthOptions` ||| An [`AuthOptions`]{@link AuthOptions} object. |
||| `TokenDetails` ||  A [`TokenDetails`]{@link TokenDetails} object. |

Note this can only be used when the API `key` value is available locally. Otherwise, the Ably [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} must be obtained from the key owner. Use this to generate an Ably [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} in order to implement an Ably Token request callback for use by other clients. Both [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} and [`AuthOptions`]{@link AuthOptions} are optional. When omitted or `null`, the default token parameters and authentication options for the client library are used, as specified in the [`ClientOptions`]{@link ClientOptions} when the client library was instantiated, or later updated with an explicit `authorize` request. Values passed in are used instead of, rather than being merged with, the default values. To understand why an Ably [`TokenRequest`]{@link TokenRequest} may be issued to clients in favor of a token, see [Token Authentication explained](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication/#token-authentication). |
|| `TokenParams` ||| A [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} object. |

Both [`TokenParams`]{@link TokenParams} and [`AuthOptions`]{@link AuthOptions} are optional. When omitted or `null`, the default token parameters and authentication options for the client library are used, as specified in the [`ClientOptions`]{@link ClientOptions} when the client library was instantiated, or later updated with an explicit `authorize` request. Values passed in are used instead of, rather than being merged with, the default values.

| revokeTokens([TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier], issuedBefore number?, allowReauthMargin boolean?) => io `BatchResult<TokenRevocationSuccessResult \| TokenRevocationFailureResult>`  ||| RSA17 | Revokes the tokens specified by the provided array of [`TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier`]{@link TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier}s. Only tokens issued by an API key that had revocable tokens enabled before the token was issued can be revoked. See the [token revocation docs](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#token-revocation) for more information. |
|| [`TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier`] ||| An array of [`TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier`]{@link TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier} objects. |
|| `issuedBefore` ||| A Unix timestamp in milliseconds where only tokens issued before this time are revoked. The default is the current time. Requests with an `issuedBefore` in the future, or more than an hour in the past, will be rejected. |

The default is `false`, meaning that the effect is near-immediate. |
||| `BatchResult<TokenRevocationSuccessResult \| TokenRevocationFailureResult>` || A [`BatchResult`]{@link BatchResult} containing information about the result of the token revocation request for each provided [`TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier`]{@link TokenRevocationTargetSpecifier}. |

## class TokenDetails

Contains an Ably Token and its associated metadata.

|  Method / Property | Parameter | Returns | Spec | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| +fromJson(String \| JsonObject) -> TokenDetails ||| TD7 | A static factory method to create a `TokenDetails` object from a deserialized `TokenDetails`-like object or a JSON stringified `TokenDetails` object. This method is provided to minimize bugs as a result of differing types by platform for fields such as `timestamp` or `ttl`. For example, in Ruby `ttl` in the `TokenDetails` object is exposed in seconds as that is idiomatic for the language, yet when serialized to JSON using `to_json` it is automatically converted to the Ably standard which is milliseconds. By using the `fromJson()` method when constructing a `TokenDetails` object, Ably ensures that all fields are consistently serialized and deserialized across platforms. |
|| `String` \| `JsonObject` ||| A deserialized `TokenDetails`-like object or a JSON stringified `TokenDetails` object. |
||| `TokenDetails` || An Ably authentication token. |

If a client ID is included, then the Ably Token authenticates its bearer as that client ID, and the Ably Token may only be used to perform operations on behalf of that client ID. The client is then considered to be an [identified client](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#identified-clients). |
| expires: Time ||| TD3 | The timestamp at which this token expires as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. |
| issued: Time ||| TD4 | The timestamp at which this token was issued as milliseconds since the Unix epoch. |
| token: String ||| TD2 | The [Ably Token](https://ably.com/docs/core-features/authentication#ably-tokens) itself. A typical Ably Token string appears with the form `xVLyHw.A-pwh7wicf3afTfgiw4k2Ku33kcnSA7z6y8FjuYpe3QaNRTEo4`. |

If the Ably `TokenRequest` is successful, the capability of the returned Ably Token will be the intersection of this capability with the capability of the issuing key. The capabilities value is a JSON-encoded representation of the resource paths and associated operations. Read more about capabilities in the [capabilities docs](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/authentication). |
| clientId: String? ||| TE2 | The client ID to associate with the requested Ably Token. When provided, the Ably Token may only be used to perform operations on behalf of that client ID. |
| keyName: String ||| TE2 | The name of the key against which this request is made. The key name is public, whereas the key secret is private. |
| mac: String ||| TE2 | The Message Authentication Code for this request. |
| nonce: String ||| TE2 | A cryptographically secure random string of at least 16 characters, used to ensure the `TokenRequest` cannot be reused. |

See the [publishing over REST on behalf of a realtime client docs](https://ably.com/docs/rest/channels#publish-on-behalf) for more info. |
| recoveryKey: String? ||| RTN16b, RTN16c | This property is deprecated and will be removed in future versions of the library. You should use [`createRecoveryKey`]{@link Connection#createRecoveryKey} method instead. |
| createRecoveryKey: String? ||| RTN16b, RTN16c | The recovery key string can be used by another client to recover this connection's state using the [`ClientOptions.recover`]{@ link ClientOptions#recover} property. It will return `nil` if connection is in the [`CLOSED`]{@link ConnectionState#CLOSED}, [`CLOSING`]{@link ConnectionState#CLOSING}, [`FAILED`]{@link ConnectionState#FAILED}, or [`SUSPENDED`]{@link ConnectionState#SUSPENDED} states, or when it does not have a connection [`key`]{@link Connection#key} (for example, if it has not yet become connected). See [connection state recovery options](ably.com/docs/connect/states) for more information. |
| serial: Int? ||| RTN10 | The serial number of the last message to be received on this connection, used automatically by the library when recovering or resuming a connection. When recovering a connection explicitly, the `recoveryKey` is used in the recover client options as it contains both the key and the last message serial. |
| state: ConnectionState ||| RTN4d | The current [`ConnectionState`]{@link ConnectionState} of the connection. |
| whenState(ConnectionState, (ConnectionStateChange?) ->) ||| RTN26 | If the connection is already in the given state, calls the listener immediately with a `null` argument. Else, calls [`once()`]{@link EventEmitter#once} to register the listener to be called the next time the connection transitions to the given state. |
|| `ConnectionState` ||| The connection state to wait for. |
|| `(ConnectionStateChange?) ->` ||| The event listener. |
| close() ||| RTN12 | Causes the connection to close, entering the [`CLOSING`]{@link ConnectionState#CLOSING} state. Once closed, the library does not attempt to re-establish the connection without an explicit call to [`connect()`]{@link Connection#connect}. |
| connect() ||| RTC1b, RTN3, RTN11 | Explicitly calling `connect()` is needed if the `autoConnect` attribute of the [`ClientOptions`]{@link ClientOptions} object is `false`. If not already connected or connecting, this method causes the connection to open, entering the [`CONNECTING`]{@link ConnectionState#CONNECTING} state. |
| ping() => io Duration ||| RTN13 | When connected, sends a heartbeat ping to the Ably server and executes the callback with any error and the response time in milliseconds when a heartbeat ping request is echoed from the server. This can be useful for measuring true round-trip latency to the connected Ably server. |
||| `Duration` || The response time in milliseconds. |

## enum ConnectionState

Describes the realtime [`Connection`]{@link Connection} object states.

| Enum | Spec | Description |
|---|---|---|
| INITIALIZED || A connection with this state has been initialized but no connection has yet been attempted. |
| CONNECTING || A connection attempt has been initiated. The connecting state is entered as soon as the library has completed initialization, and is reentered each time connection is re-attempted following disconnection. |
| CONNECTED || A connection exists and is active. |
| DISCONNECTED || A temporary failure condition. No current connection exists because there is no network connectivity or no host is available. The disconnected state is entered if an established connection is dropped, or if a connection attempt was unsuccessful. In the disconnected state the library will periodically attempt to open a new connection (approximately every 15 seconds), anticipating that the connection will be re-established soon and thus connection and channel continuity will be possible. In this state, developers can continue to publish messages as they are automatically placed in a local queue, to be sent as soon as a connection is reestablished. Messages published by other clients while this client is disconnected will be delivered to it upon reconnection, so long as the connection was resumed within 2 minutes. After 2 minutes have elapsed, recovery is no longer possible and the connection will move to the `SUSPENDED` state. |
| SUSPENDED || A long term failure condition. No current connection exists because there is no network connectivity or no host is available. The suspended state is entered after a failed connection attempt if there has then been no connection for a period of two minutes. In the suspended state, the library will periodically attempt to open a new connection every 30 seconds. Developers are unable to publish messages in this state. A new connection attempt can also be triggered by an explicit call to [`connect()`]{@link Connection#connect}. Once the connection has been re-established, channels will be automatically re-attached. The client has been disconnected for too long for them to resume from where they left off, so if it wants to catch up on messages published by other clients while it was disconnected, it needs to use the [History API](https://ably.com/docs/realtime/history). |
| CLOSING || An explicit request by the developer to close the connection has been sent to the Ably service. If a reply is not received from Ably within a short period of time, the connection is forcibly terminated and the connection state becomes `CLOSED`. |
| CLOSED || The connection has been explicitly closed by the client. In the closed state, no reconnection attempts are made automatically by the library, and clients may not publish messages. No connection state is preserved by the service or by the library. A new connection attempt can be triggered by an explicit call to [`connect()`]{@link Connection#connect}, which results in a new connection. |
| FAILED || This state is entered if the client library encounters a failure condition that it cannot recover from. This may be a fatal connection error received from the Ably service, for example an attempt to connect with an incorrect API key, or a local terminal error, for example the token in use has expired and the library does not have any way to renew it. In the failed state, no reconnection attempts are made automatically by the library, and clients may not publish messages. A new connection attempt can be triggered by an explicit call to [`connect()`]{@link Connection#connect}. |

However, all subsequent events emitted would not invoke the listener as `once()` ensures that each registration is only invoked once. |
|| `Data` ||| The event listener. |
| once(Event, (Data...) ->) ||| RTE4 | Registers the provided listener for the first occurrence of a single named event specified as the `Event` argument. If `once()` is called more than once with the same listener, the listener is added multiple times to its listener registry. Therefore, as an example, assuming the same listener is registered twice using `once()`, and an event is emitted once, the listener would be invoked twice. However, all subsequent events emitted would not invoke the listener as `once()` ensures that each registration is only invoked once. |
|| `Event` ||| The named event to listen for. |

|| `Event` ||| The named event. |
|| `Data` ||| The event listener. |
| emit(Event, Data...) ||| internal, RTE6 | Emits an event, calling registered listeners with the given event name and any other given arguments. If an exception is raised in any of the listeners, the exception is caught by the `EventEmitter` and the exception is logged to the Ably logger. |
